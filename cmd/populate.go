// populateCmd represents the import command
var populateCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "populate",
	Short: "Populate cat tracks from stdin stream",
	Long: `

Tracks from mixed cats ARE supported, e.g. master.json.gz.

Tracks are decoded as JSON lines from stdin and grouped by cat before decoding into CatTracks.
Graceful shutdown is MANDATORY for data integrity. Be patient.

This command can run idempotently, and incrementally on the same source,
at least so far as a line-scan count will take it.
The cat app, as it is, though, has no strong way of persistent de-duping, yet.

Examples:

  zcat master.json.gz | catd populate --workers 12 --batch-size 100_000 --sort true

Notes:

Same-source, re-runs:

A record is stored in /tmp of the number of lines read (and processed), and if that cache is found
on restart, that number of lines will be skipped (fast!) before processing begins.
This assumes that the input is consistent between runs through that line number - 
so interim append-only operations on the source may be OK, but changing the source entirely will 
cause unexpected and unreasonable outcomes.  

Ordering and sorting:

MOST tracks are ordered defacto -- they were created, listed, pushed, and appended cat-chronologically, 
and generally close to globally-chronologically (albeit with many riffles at the per-cat edges due to async client recording and pushing).
But some tracks aren't; either because of client bugs or adhoc retrospective cat tracking.
For example, about a year in to the CatTrack life I pushed some old GPS records I had from biking in Boston years earlier.
While tracks within a batch can/will get sorted, there is no guarantee that ALL tracks
for any cat are ordered. This isn't a huge deal given that 
a) again, MOST tracks ARE already sorted.
b) operations that depend on chronology, like TripDetector, are stateful 
   and can handle out-of-order tracks by breaking/resetting on temporal discontinuity.

Since we want to process each cat's tracks chronologically (according to the order they were saved),
the best (at optimum) we can do as far as parallelization is, basically, to run one thread for each cat.
Implementation uses the atomic package to ensure incremental worker order, where the workers block until
their increment is matched, but once matched, different-cat workers will not block (on state).
This permits different-cat batches to run in parallel, but ensures same-cat batches wait politely in order.

But we are still limited by the source input order. For example, if rye cat has posted 1_000_000 tracks at once,
then master.json.gz will have 10 batches (of 100_000) to consume before any other cat's tracks can be processed -
and these will all be serially blocking. This is an inherent limitation of the input format and the way we process it.

Processing goes at the rate of about 7000-8000 tracks/cat/second, or about 15s/100_000 cat batch.
A master.json.gz with a majority of 2 cats represented flows at around 15000 tracks/second.
